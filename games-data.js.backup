You'll pilot a sleek triangular ship through an endless, abstract landscape filled with geometric obstacles. The minimalist black and white visuals create a hypnotic environment that becomes increasingly challenging as your speed accelerates and obstacles multiply.",
    "longDescription": "What begins as a serene journey quickly transforms into an intense test of concentration and quick decision-making. As you progress, the cube formations become more complex and unpredictable, requiring split-second navigation choices to survive. The game's elegant simplicity masks its addictive challenge – the urge to beat your previous distance record will keep you coming back for \"just one more run\" as you strive to master the geometric gauntlet.",
    "gameplayDescription": "In Cube Field, you control a triangular ship navigating through a sea of white cubes against a black background. Your objective is simple: survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the cubes. You'll move left and right to navigate through gaps while automatically advancing forward at an ever-increasing speed. The game begins with a relatively sparse field of cubes, but quickly escalates as cube formations become denser and more complex. Some formations create corridor-like passages you must navigate, while others form barriers with small openings to squeeze through. Your score increases based on the distance traveled, with milestones unlocking higher difficulty levels. The balance of simple controls and complex obstacle patterns creates an accessible yet deeply challenging experience that rewards precision and foresight.",
